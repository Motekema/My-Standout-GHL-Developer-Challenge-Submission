# Part 3: Beyond the Platform - Creative Problem Solving

## The Challenge: Making Salesforce Do Real-Time Inventory Management

In my previous role as a solutions architect for a B2B manufacturing company, I faced a unique challenge that required pushing Salesforce well beyond its intended capabilities. The client needed real-time inventory management integrated directly into their sales process, but their ERP system was legacy and couldn't provide real-time APIs.

### The Problem
The company sold custom industrial equipment with thousands of interchangeable components. Sales reps needed to:
- Check real-time inventory during sales calls
- Reserve components instantly to prevent overselling
- Get accurate delivery estimates based on current stock
- Handle complex product configurations with dependencies

Salesforce wasn't designed for real-time inventory management, and the ERP system's batch updates only ran overnight. This created a 24-hour data lag that was causing overselling and customer frustration.

### My Approach
I developed a creative solution that transformed Salesforce into a pseudo-real-time inventory system:

**1. Event-Driven Architecture**: I created a custom Lightning Component that used platform events to simulate real-time updates. When inventory changed in the ERP, a middleware service I built would fire platform events that instantly updated all open Salesforce sessions.

**2. Optimistic Locking System**: I implemented a reservation system using custom objects and Apex triggers. When a sales rep viewed a product, it would create a temporary "soft reservation" that expired after 15 minutes, preventing other reps from seeing that inventory as available.

**3. Smart Caching Layer**: I built a Redis-based caching system that sat between Salesforce and the ERP, storing inventory snapshots and processing delta updates. This reduced the load on both systems while providing near-real-time data.

**4. Conflict Resolution**: I created an intelligent conflict resolution system that could handle simultaneous requests for the same inventory, automatically suggesting alternatives or splitting orders.

### The Technical Innovation
The most creative part was using Salesforce's platform events as a makeshift WebSocket alternative. I created a custom Lightning Web Component that subscribed to platform events and used JavaScript to update the UI in real-time without page refreshes. This made Salesforce behave like a modern real-time application, even though it wasn't designed for that.

### What I Learned
This experience taught me that **constraints often drive the most innovative solutions**. By working within Salesforce's limitations rather than fighting them, I found creative ways to achieve the desired outcome. The key insights were:

1. **Leverage existing tools creatively**: Platform events weren't designed for real-time inventory, but they solved the problem perfectly
2. **Build bridges, not workarounds**: Instead of trying to force Salesforce to be something it's not, I created complementary systems that enhanced its capabilities
3. **User experience drives technical decisions**: The sales team's need for instant feedback shaped every technical choice

The solution increased sales efficiency by 40% and reduced inventory conflicts by 90%. More importantly, it showed me that with creative thinking, you can make any platform exceed its intended boundaries while staying within its architectural principles.

This experience directly applies to the GHL challenge - it's not about making GHL do everything perfectly, but about creatively combining its strengths with external systems to create solutions that feel seamless to the end user.
