## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Core Components**

#### 1. **Enhanced Lead Router** (`routerTest.js`)
```javascript
// Real-world decision making
const distance = await calculateDistanceReal(leadZip, location.zipCode);
const capacityScore = (100 - location.currentCapacity) / 100;
const leadScore = calculateLeadScore(leadData);
const finalScore = (proximityScore * 0.4) + (capacityScore * 0.3) + (leadScore * 0.3);
```

#### 2. **Production Router Class** (`production-router.js`)
```javascript
class ProductionLeadRouter {
  constructor() {
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.metrics = new RouterMetrics();
    this.errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Interactive Dashboard** (`franchise-dashboard.html`)
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live performance tracking
- **Dark Mode Design**: Professional UI/UX
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all devices
- **Single-Page Application**: No scrolling, optimized viewport

## 🚀 GHL Integration Points

### **Custom Code Actions**
```javascript
// Direct integration with GHL workflows
const routingResult = await routeLeadToLocation(leadData);
await ghl.assignToSubAccount(routingResult.selectedLocation.subAccountId);
await ghl.triggerWorkflow(routingResult.workflowId);
```

### **Webhook Integration**
```javascript
// Real-time lead processing
app.post('/webhook/lead', async (req, res) => {
  const lead = req.body;
  const routing = await router.routeLead(lead);
  await notifyLocation(routing.selectedLocation, lead);
});
```

### **Sub-Account Management**
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Leads routed to appropriate sub-accounts
